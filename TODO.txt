TODO: Update World Grid to contain what asset texture || block type is on a space
	  Example: Forest Biome, Basic Forest Tile
			   Forest Biome, Burnt Tile
			   Mountain Biome, Stone Tile
	  This will be helpful for potentially having certain tiles be more beneficial. Or the player might
	  be able to place tiles in the future. Will be nice for saving and loading the world as well.

TODO: Add inventory
TODO: Add Planter Entity
TODO: Add Fire
	  Fire can spread to nearby tiles
	  This will require the expansion of the world grid system to include if a tile has an effect on it
	  Helpful for save loading
	  Helpful for spells that linger || oil on the ground
	  Example: A tile can be in the forest biome, with a tree, and have oil on it.
			   Then if a player sets the tile on fire it will burn a lot hotter
	  Example: If a tile is on fire and water is applied, the fire goes out. Same with the 
			   oppisite. If a tile has water on it, it cannot be set on fire.
	  GREAT FOR COMBOS!!!!
